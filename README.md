# tinysoil2

This is a version of the SOIL2 library that will create ONLY a static
64 bit linux version of the library. 

To create the library just type "make".  It should create a directory
called SOIL2 that contains the static library and the include file 
for your code.  Copy the SOIL2 directory to your development directory.
